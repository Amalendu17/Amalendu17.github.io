Welcome to my professional portfolio! I'm a trained Geophysicist with hands-on experience in seismic data analysis, microseismic processing and monitoring, machine learning, and reservoir characterization. My academic and industry background bridges the gap between Earth science and AI, making me well-suited for cross-disciplinary roles in energy, environmental analytics, and computational geoscience.
